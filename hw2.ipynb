        "2. Repeat for the sequence length:\n",
        "    1. For each beam in the beam list:\n",
        "        1. Compute the next distribution over the output space for that state\n",

        "- np.random.choice and torch.multinomial will both help with the sampling as they can take in a weighted probability distribution and sample from that distribution.\n",
        "- For beam search you will need to keep a running score of the likelihood of each sequence. If you multiply the likelihoods, you will encounter float underflow. Instead, you should add the log likelihoods.\n",
        "- For beam search, you will need to keep track of multiple hidden states related to which branch you are currently expanding.\n",
        "- For beam search, you should search over the beam, but only return the top result in the end.\n",
        "- It may be useful to do the training part before the character generation part so you have some model to test.\n",

        "1. Just like last time, provide plots for training error, test error, and test accuracy. Also provide a plot of your train and test perplexity per epoch.\n",
        "    - In class we defined perplexity as `2^(p*log_2(q))`, However the PyTorch cross entropy function uses the natural log. To compute perplexity directly from the cross entropy, you should use `e^p*ln(q)`.\n",

        "4. Which sampling method seemed to generate the best results? Why do you think that is?\n",
        "5. For sampling and beam search, try multiple temperatures between 0 and 2. \n",
        "    - Which produces the best outputs? Best as in made the most sense, your favorite, or funniest, doesn't really matter how you decide.\n",
        "    - What does a temperature of 0 do? What does a temperature of 0<temp<1 do? What does a temperature of 1 do? What does a temperature of above 1 do? What would a negative temperature do (assuming the code allowed for negative temperature)?\n",
